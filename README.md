Application Name: Detourist

Application Type: Sightseeing App

When visiting a new city, you are most probably familiar with one or two of the main
attractions there. For example, if you go to Paris you know you have to visit the Eiffel tower.
If you visit Rome, visiting the Coliseum is a must. However, Rome and Paris aren’t just the 
Coliseum and the Eiffel tower. We know there must be restaurants in both of these cities 
that serve spectacular food, or hidden places far from the sight of tourists that would give 
you a true insight into the daily lives of the regular citizens of these cities. 
However, just giving you a list of these places does not constitute a plan. A plan must come 
with instructions and guidance. This is essentially the idea we came up with. The three main 
factors in our plan are the destinations to visit; a time schedule to abide by; and instructions 
on how to reach there and go on to the next destination.
Lots of existing solutions give you nice places to go to, but you will then have to open up two
more apps to organize your trip for public transportation & organization. So instead of doing 
all that, the idea is to combine all these features in one place.
Based on the idea that you decide one main attraction, the app should be as simple as the 
user entering a destination and everything is sorted out for him. He would get a list of places 
to go to, with the time schedule for each stop and the instructions on which form of public 
transport to use or to walk if that is the most efficient way to reach there.
The project Detourist addresses tourists visiting a city as well as new citizens moving to that 
particular city. Mostly, one is interested in seeing typical sights, discovering new and famous 
places, and also just having fun by spending a free day in the city. Since sightseeing tours are 
generally done by walk, Detourist combines walking and public transportation, and acts as a 
virtual tour guide. The tourist, using Detourist, sets a target location and triggers the 
application to guide her from her current position to the target location.
